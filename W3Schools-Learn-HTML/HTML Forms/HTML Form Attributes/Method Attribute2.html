<!-- Example
This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>The method Attribute</h2>

    <p>This form will be submitted using the POST method:</p>

    <form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank" method="post">
      <label for="fname">First name:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John" /><br />
      <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe" /><br /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>

    <p>After you submit, notice that, unlike the GET method, the form values is NOT visible in the address bar of the new browser tab.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information! -->
