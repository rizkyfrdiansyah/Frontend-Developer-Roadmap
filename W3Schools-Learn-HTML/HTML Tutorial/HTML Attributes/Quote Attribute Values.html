<!-- We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>About W3Schools</h1>

    <p title="About" W3Schools>You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value if the value contains spaces.</p>

    <p><b> If you move the mouse over the paragraph above, your browser will only display the first word from the title. </b></p>
  </body>
</html>
