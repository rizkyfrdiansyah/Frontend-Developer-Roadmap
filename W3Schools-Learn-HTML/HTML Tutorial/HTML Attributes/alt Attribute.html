<!-- The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. -->

    <h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
    <p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image get an understanding of what the image contains:</p>

    <img src="img/img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket" width="500" height="600" />

    <!-- example2 -->
    <img src="img/img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket" />

    <p>If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead.</p>
