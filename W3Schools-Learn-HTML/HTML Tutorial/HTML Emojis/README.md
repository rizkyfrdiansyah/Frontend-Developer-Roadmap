# Using Emojis in HTML

Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗

# What are Emojis?

Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

# The HTML charset Attribute

To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the `<meta>` tag:

`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.

# Example Explained

The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` element defines the character set.

The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67.

To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon).
