<!-- UTF-8 Characters
Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

A is 65
B is 66
C is 67
Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <body>
    <p>I will display A B C</p>
    <p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>
  </body>
</html>
