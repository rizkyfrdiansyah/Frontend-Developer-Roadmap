    <!-- Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element. -->
    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

    <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <!-- Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. -->
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

    <!-- The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: -->
    <div style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 20px">
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: -->
    <h1>The span element</h1>

    <p>My mother has <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color: darkolivegreen; font-weight: bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
