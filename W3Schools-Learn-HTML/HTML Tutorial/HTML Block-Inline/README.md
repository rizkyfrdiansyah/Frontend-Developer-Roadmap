# HTML Block and Inline Elements

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

The two most common display values are block and inline.

### Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

`<address>`
`<article>`
`<aside>`
`<blockquote>`
`<canvas>`
`<dd>`
`<div>`
`<dl>`
`<dt>`
`<fieldset>`
`<figcaption>`
`<figure>`
`<footer>`
`<form>`
`<h1>-<h6>`
`<header>`
`<hr>`
`<li>`
`<main>`
`<nav>`
`<noscript>`
`<ol>`
`<p>`
`<pre>`
`<section>`
`<table>`
`<tfoot>`
`<ul>`
`<video>`

### Here are the inline elements in HTML:

`<a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>`
Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

# Chapter Summary

- A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
- An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
- The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
- The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
