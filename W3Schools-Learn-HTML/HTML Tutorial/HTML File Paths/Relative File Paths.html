<!-- Relative File Paths
A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Using a Relative File Path</h2>
    <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width: 300px" />
  </body>
</html>
