<!-- The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Alternative text</h2>

    <p>The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image get an understanding of what the image contains:</p>

    <img src="img/img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania" width="460" height="345" />
  </body>
</html>
