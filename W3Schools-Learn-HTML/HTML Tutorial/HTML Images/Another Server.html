<!-- Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Images on Another Server</h2>

    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" style="width: 104px; height: 142px" />
  </body>
</html>
