<!-- Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Images in Another Folder</h2>
    <p>It is common to store images in a sub-folder. You must then include the folder name in the src attribute:</p>

    <img src="img/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width: 128px; height: 128px" />
  </body>
</html>
