# HTML Images

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

# HTML Images Syntax

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
  `<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">`

# Chapter Summary

- Use the HTML `<img>` element to define an image
- Use the HTML `src` attribute to define the URL of the image
- Use the HTML `alt` attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
- Use the HTML `width and height` attributes or the CSS `width and height` properties to define the size of the image
- Use the CSS `float` property to let the image float to the left or to the right
