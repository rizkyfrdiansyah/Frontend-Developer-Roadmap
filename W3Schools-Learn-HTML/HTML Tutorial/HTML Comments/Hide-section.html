<!-- You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the -->
<!-- and the -->
<!-- will be hidden from the display. -->

<!-- Example
Hide a section of HTML code: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
    <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.
