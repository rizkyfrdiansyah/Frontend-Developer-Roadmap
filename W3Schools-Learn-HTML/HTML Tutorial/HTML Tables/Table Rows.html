<!-- Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.

tr stands for table row.

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <style>
    table,
    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
  </style>
  <body>
    <h2>TR elements define table rows</h2>

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tr>
        <td>Emil</td>
        <td>Tobias</td>
        <td>Linus</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>10</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To understand the example better, we have added borders to the table.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- You can have as many rows as you like in a table; just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.

Note: There are times when a row can have less or more cells than another. You will learn about that in a later chapter. -->
