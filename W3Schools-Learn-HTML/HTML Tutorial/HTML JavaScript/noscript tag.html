<!-- The HTML <noscript> Tag
The HTML <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
    </script>

    <noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>

    <p>A browser without support for JavaScript will show the text written inside the noscript element.</p>
  </body>
</html>
