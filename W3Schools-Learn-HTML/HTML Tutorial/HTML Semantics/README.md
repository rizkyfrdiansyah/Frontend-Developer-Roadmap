# HTML Semantic Elements

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

# What are Semantic Elements?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div> and <span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: `<form>, <table>, and <article>` - Clearly defines its content.

# Semantic Elements in HTML

Many web sites contain HTML code like: `<div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer">` to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:
`<article>`
`<aside>`
`<details>`
`<figcaption>`
`<figure>`
`<footer>`
`<header>`
`<main>`
`<mark>`
`<nav>`
`<section>`
`<summary>`
`<time>`

# Nesting `<article> in <section>` or Vice Versa?

The `<article>` element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The `<section>` element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, you will find HTML pages with `<section>` elements containing `<article>` elements, and `<article>` elements containing `<section>` elements.

# Why Semantic Elements?

According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."
