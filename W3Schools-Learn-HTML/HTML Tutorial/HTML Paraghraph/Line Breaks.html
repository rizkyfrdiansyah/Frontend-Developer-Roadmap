<!-- HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is<br />a paragraph<br />with line breaks.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. -->
