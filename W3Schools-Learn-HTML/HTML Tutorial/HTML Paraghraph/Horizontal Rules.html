<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. -->
