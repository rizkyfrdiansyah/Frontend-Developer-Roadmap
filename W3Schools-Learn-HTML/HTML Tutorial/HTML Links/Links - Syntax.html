<!-- HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>HTML Links</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look! -->
