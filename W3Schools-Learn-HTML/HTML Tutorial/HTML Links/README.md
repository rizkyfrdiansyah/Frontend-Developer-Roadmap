## HTML Links - Syntax

The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax: `<a href="url">link text</a>`

The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
