  <!-- Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com: 
By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
-->
  <body>
    <h1>HTML Links</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a></p>

    <!-- HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window -->

    <h2>The target Attribute</h2>

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

    <p>If target="_blank", the link will open in a new browser window or tab.</p>

    <!-- Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part): -->
    <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

    <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
    <p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

    <!-- HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: -->
    <h2>Image as a Link</h2>

    <p>The image below is a link. Try to click on it.</p>

    <a href="default.asp"><img src="img/smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width: 42px; height: 42px" /></a>

    <!-- Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email): -->
    <h2>Link to an Email Address</h2>

    <p>To create a link that opens in the user's email program (to let them send a new email), use mailto: inside the href attribute:</p>

    <p><a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a></p>

    <!-- Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button: -->
    <h2>Button as a Links</h2>

    <p>Click the button to go to the HTML tutorial.</p>

    <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

    <!-- Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. -->
    <h2>Link Titles</h2>
    <p>The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

    <p><a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a></p>
