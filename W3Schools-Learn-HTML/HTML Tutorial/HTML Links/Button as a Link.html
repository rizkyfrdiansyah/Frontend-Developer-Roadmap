<!-- Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>Button as a Links</h2>

    <p>Click the button to go to the HTML tutorial.</p>

    <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
  </body>
</html>
