<!-- Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: powderblue;
      }
      h1 {
        color: blue;
      }
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
