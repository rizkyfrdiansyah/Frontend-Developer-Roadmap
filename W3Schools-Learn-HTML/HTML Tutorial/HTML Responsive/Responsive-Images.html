<!-- Responsive Images
Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Responsive Image</h2>
    <p>When the CSS width property is set in a percentage value, the image will scale up and down when resizing the browser window. Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>

    <img src="img/img_girl.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
  </body>
</html>
<!-- Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. -->
