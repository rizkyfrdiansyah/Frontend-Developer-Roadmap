<!-- Using the max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Responsive Image</h2>
    <p>"max-width:100%" prevents the image from getting bigger than its original size. However, if you make the browser window smaller, the image will still scale down.</p>
    <p>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>

    <img src="img/img_girl.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto" />
  </body>
</html>
