<!-- Setting The Viewport
To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Setting the Viewport</h2>
    <p>This example does not really do anything, other than showing you how to add the viewport meta element.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: -->
