    <!-- The HTML <title> Element
The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

A simple HTML document: -->
    <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
    <!-- The HTML <script> Element
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.

The following JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo": -->
    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
      }
    </script>
    <!-- Example of <meta> tags: -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript" />
    <meta name="author" content="John Doe" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css" />
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: powderblue;
      }
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>

    <!-- The HTML <base> Element
The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.

The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.

There can only be one single <base> element in a document! -->
    <base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The content of the body element is displayed in the browser window.</p>
    <p>The content of the title element is displayed in the browser tab, in favorites and in search-engine results.</p>

    <!-- The HTML <style> Element
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page: -->
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <p>The content of the body element is displayed in the browser window.</p>
    <p>The content of the title element is displayed in the browser tab, in favorites and in search-engine results.</p>

    <!-- The HTML <link> Element
The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:

Example -->
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!-- Example of <meta> tags: -->
    <p>All meta information goes inside the head section.</p>

    <!-- The HTML <script> Element
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.

The following JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo": -->
    <h1>My Web Page</h1>
    <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

    <!-- The HTML <base> Element
The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.

The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.

There can only be one single <base> element in a document! -->
    <h1>The base element</h1>

    <p>
      <img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman" /> - Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image
      at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".
    </p>

    <p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
