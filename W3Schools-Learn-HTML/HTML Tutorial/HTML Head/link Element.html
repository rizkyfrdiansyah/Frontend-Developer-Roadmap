<!-- The HTML <link> Element
The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
