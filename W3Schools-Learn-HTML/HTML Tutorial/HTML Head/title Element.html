<!-- The HTML <title> Element
The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

A simple HTML document:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The content of the body element is displayed in the browser window.</p>
    <p>The content of the title element is displayed in the browser tab, in favorites and in search-engine results.</p>
  </body>
</html>
