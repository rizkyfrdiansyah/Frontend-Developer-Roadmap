# HTML Symbols

Symbols or letters that are not present on your keyboard can be added to HTML using entities.

# HTML Symbol Entities

HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol:

## Example

Display the euro sign:

`<p>I will display &euro;</p`>
`<p>I will display &#8364;</p>`
`<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>`
