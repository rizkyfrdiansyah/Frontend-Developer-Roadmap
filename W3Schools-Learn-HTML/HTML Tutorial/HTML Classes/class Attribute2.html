<!-- In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of "note". Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .note {
        font-size: 120%;
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
    <p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

Note: The class name is case sensitive!
