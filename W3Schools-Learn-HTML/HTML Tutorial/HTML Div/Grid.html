<!-- Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.

Example
How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side:

<style>
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
}
</style>
Result -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Grid Example</h1>

        <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>

      <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>

    </div>
  </body>
</html>
