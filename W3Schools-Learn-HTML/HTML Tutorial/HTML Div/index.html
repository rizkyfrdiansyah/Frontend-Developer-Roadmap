  <!-- The <div> Element
The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after. -->

    <h1>HTML DIV Example</h1>

    Lorem Ipsum
    <div>I am a div</div>
    dolor sit amet.

    <p>The yellow background is added to demonstrate the footprint of the DIV element.</p>

    <!-- <div> as a container
The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

Example
A <div> element with HTML elements: -->

    <div>
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
      <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The yellow background is added to demonstrate the footprint of the DIV element.</p>

    <!-- Center align a <div> element
If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto. -->
    <h1>Center align a DIV element</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
      <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Multiple <div> elements
You can have many <div> containers on the same page. -->
    <h1>Multiple DIV Elements</h1>

    <div style="background-color: #fff4a3">
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
      <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #ffc0c7">
      <h2>Oslo</h2>
      <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
      <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
      <h2>Rome</h2>
      <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
      <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <p>CSS styles are added to make it easier to separate the divs, and to meake them more pretty:)</p>

    <!-- Float
The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.

The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allow elements float next to each other instead of on top of each other.

Example
How to use float to align div elements side by side: -->
    <div class="mycontainer">
      <div style="background-color: #fff4a3">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
        <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #ffc0c7">
        <h2>Oslo</h2>
        <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
        <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
        <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Inline-block
If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.

Example
How to use display: inline-block to align div elements side by side: -->
    <div style="background-color: #fff4a3">
      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
      <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #ffc0c7">
      <h2>Oslo</h2>
      <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
      <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
      <h2>Rome</h2>
      <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
      <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Flex
The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.

Example
How to use flex to align div elements side by side: -->
    <h1>Flexbox Example</h1>

    <p>Align three DIV elements side by side.</p>

    <div class="mycontainer">
      <div style="background-color: #fff4a3">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
        <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #ffc0c7">
        <h2>Oslo</h2>
        <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
        <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
        <p>Rome has almost 3 million.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.

Example
How to use grid to align <div> elements side by side: -->
    <h1>Grid Example</h1>

    <p>Align three DIV elements side by side.</p>

    <div class="grid-container">
      <div style="background-color: #fff4a3">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
        <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #ffc0c7">
        <h2>Oslo</h2>
        <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
        <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
      </div>

      <div style="background-color: #d9eee1">
        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
        <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
