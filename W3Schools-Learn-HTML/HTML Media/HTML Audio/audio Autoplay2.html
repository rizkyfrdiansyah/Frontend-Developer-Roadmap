<!-- Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your audio file start playing automatically (but muted):

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <audio controls autoplay muted>
      <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
      <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
  </body>
</html>
