# HTML Video

The HTML `<video>` element is used to show a video on a web page.

## How it Works

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The `<source>` element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the `<video>` and `</video>` tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the `<video>` element.

## HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events

The HTML DOM defines methods, properties, and events for the `<video>` element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.
