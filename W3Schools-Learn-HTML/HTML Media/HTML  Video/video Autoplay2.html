<!-- Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
      <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
  </body>
</html>
