<!-- The <object> Element
The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
  </body>
</html>
