<!-- The <embed> Element
The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <embed src="audi.jpeg" />
  </body>
</html>
